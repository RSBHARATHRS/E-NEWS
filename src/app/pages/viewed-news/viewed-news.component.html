  <h3>Sunrise</h3>
  <p>Sunrise or sun up is the instant at which the upper edge of the Sun appears over the horizon in the morning. The
    term can also refer to the entire process of the Sun crossing the horizon and its accompanying atmospheric effects.

  <p>Although the Sun appears to "rise" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to
    appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent
    motion is so convincing
    that most cultures had mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer
    Nicolaus Copernicus first formulated the heliocentric model in the 16th century.</p>
